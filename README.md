# GoDUENoLootLimit
Mod for Guild of Dungeoneering Ultimate Edition which removes the loot gold cap.

Note - this is only for the Ultimate Edition.  The standard edition has no caps.

Getting a bit behind in the start of the game?  Tired of the paltry 15 gold per quest when saving up for the next 750 gold upgrade?

Well toil no longer!  This mod changes the gold limit for the quests to 1000!  
Want to collect enough candlesticks to walk from New York to the UK?  Knock yourself out!

Want to have custom caps for the map exploration, loot, and monster gold?  Simply change the values in the config file.

# Installation

1. Download the BepInEx utility from https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v5.4.17/BepInEx_x64_5.4.17.0.zip
2. Extract the contents of the zip file into the game's directory (which is GuildofDungeoneeringUlt)
	- There should now be a BepinEx folder in the GuildofDungeoneeringUlt game directory.
3. Run the game and exit once the main screen is shown.
4. If BepInEx ran correctly, there should now be BepInEx\plugins directory in the game directory.
5. Download the latest GoDUENoLootLimit.dll from here:  https://github.com/NBKRedSpy/GoDUENoLootLimit/releases
6. Copy the GoDUENoLootLimit.dll into the BepInEx\plugins directory.
7. Run the game.

During a quest, the maximum gold possible will now show a value over 1,000.

# Optional Configuration
After running the game with the plugin, there will be a config file called GoDUENoLootLimit.cfg located in the 
BepInEx\config\ folder which allows the user to customize the gold caps.  The Map, Loot, and Monster gold caps can be individually configured.

When the game is not running, edit the file in notepad and set the gold caps to whatever value is desired.  
Use zero to use the game's default cap instead.
